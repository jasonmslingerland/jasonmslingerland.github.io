I purchased a dropped 2009 Ducati Monster 696 with 2500 miles and with a clean title. There was a large hole in the crankcase that appeared to have damaged the case itself and no internal parts.

Upon disassembly, I found that I was correct that the rest of internals were healthy aside from the crankcase. I also discovered all of the motor mounts cracked and needed welding as well.

I welded 6061 aluminum plate shaped by hand to the cast aluminum crankcase to cover the hole in the crankcase. I turned round bar 6061 to the diameter of the motor mounts and drilled the stock to the motor mount hardware size. I then shaped the mounts with an air tool. 

I reassembled the motorcycle and it started up the first try.

The welds were only slightly porous, Only leaking oil when it has time to pool at the bottom of the crankcase.
