RPI FSAE 2013 Intake. 

The initial design goal was to take advantage of the inertial supercharging effect of the Honda CBR 600 f4i at common RPMs. 

The Helmholtz Residencies of the engine were obtained through an engine simulation in Ricardo Wave.

Characteristic runner lengths were then found.

All parts were optimized in Solidworks Flow Simulation and ANSYS Fluent. 

Parts were sent to HARBEC to be printed out of PA2200, a fuel and heat resistant material.
