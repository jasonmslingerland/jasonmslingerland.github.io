Instead of going to IKEA, I knew I could make a better looking and stronger coffee table myself.

I purchased lacewood from the local wood shop and jointed it with dowels and glue.

After the glue dried I planed the tabletop and polyurethane it to show off the intricate grain.

I machined and welded the aluminum legs in the local makerspace.

Knowing the leg assemblies would shrink after welding, I chose to drill the bottom holes in the aluminum plate after welding. I located the holes off of a 3d printed jig using the countersinks on the top plate.

After the bottom holes were drilled, I made sure the width tabletop fit in between the legs by using a jointer until the tabletop slid in with minimal effort. 

I then drilled through the tabletop using another 3d printed jig that located the drilling axis off the existing holes and ensured consistent table stick out from the legs.
