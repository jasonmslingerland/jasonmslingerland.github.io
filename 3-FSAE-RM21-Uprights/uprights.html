  <h1>RPI Formula SAE Upright deisgn</h1>


<p>Upright design began with bearing selection</p>
<ul>
<li>Bearing loading was created by using the mass of a 650lb car and driver and a 2g. This allowed for unknown forces and anomalies when driving.</li>
<li>Going through 150km cycle length, size and cost, three bearings were chosen as potential options.</li>
<li>6813 sealed bearings were chosen for the rear because they were big enough to have internally mounted CV joints.</li>
<li>6908 sealed bearings were selected for their lower moment of inertia.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Designing the geometry</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspension geometries were selected from Optimum K, a program that optimizes geometry points based on certain goals.</li>
<li>All four uprights were designed around the origin of the car, allowing for static camber of -.3 degrees to be designed in</li>
<li>Inspiration of shape came from the teamâ€™s manufacturing capabilities. If the parts could not be made by a sponsor with CNC capabilities, the parts could be made in house on a 3-axis mill with a rotary table.</li>
<li>A 0.0005" press fit after anodizing was achieved for the bearing surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing</p>
<ul>
<li>Parts were manufactured by PVA, Precision Valve and Automation. A hard, black anodize was also applied by the company after machining.</li>
<li>I did not do any of the coding myself for the parts or tooling required.</li>
</ul>
